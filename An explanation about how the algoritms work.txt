A deeper explanation on how the algorithms work :

The function first searches for albums by the given artist name on YTMusic.

It then iterates over the first three album results and tries to find a track with the exact same name as the given track name. If it finds a match, it returns the track information.

If the function can't find the track in the albums, it then searches for songs by the given track name and artist name.

Depending on the yt_search_algo parameter, it performs one of the following actions:

If yt_search_algo is 0, it simply returns the first song result.

If yt_search_algo is 1, it iterates over the song results and returns the first song that matches the track name, artist name, and album name exactly. If it can't find a match, it raises a ValueError.

If yt_search_algo is 2, it performs a fuzzy match. It removes everything in brackets in the song title and checks for a match with the track name, artist name, and album name. If it can't find a match, it then searches for videos with the track name and artist name. If it still can't find a match, it raises a ValueError.

If the function can't find the track using any of the above methods, it raises a ValueError.
